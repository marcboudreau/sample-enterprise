# sample-opensource

This repository contains an imaginary project that would be open-sourced. It's related repository sample-enterprise contains all of this code with some additional non-open-sourced code.

This repository is used to demonstrate a structured process for making changes to both repositories in a way that keeps a clean git history. Specifically, changes to files present in this repository are committed and pushed to this repository first. Then those commits are cherry-picked into the sample-enterprise repository.
